# Arduino Sensors & Projects Collection  
**Author:** Furkan Ege  
**License:** GPL-3.0  
**Status:** Public – Fully Open-Source

This repository contains my complete collection of Arduino-based sensor projects, prototypes and educational examples.  
All projects are organized by **sensor type**, following a clean and scalable directory structure (e.g. `DHT11/`, `LDR/`, `KY-026_Flame/`, `MQ-2_Gas/`, `KY-039_Heartbeat/` etc.)

I believe **software = transparency**, so every project -from the first simple code I wrote to the most advanced prototypes- is fully shared and openly accessible.

## 🧪 **Project Purposes**
Each folder contains:
- Clean **Arduino code**
- Proper **English descriptions**
- Hardware explanations  
- Serial Monitor output examples  
- Real-world use-case notes  

My goal is simple:  
> *Keeping electronics education accessible, transparent and reusable.*
